# 3D Rotation Matrix

An 3 x 3 rotation matrix storing the rotation.
This is a simple wrapper for a [StaticArrays](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/StaticArrays.jl) `SMatrix{3,3,T}`.
A rotation matrix `R` should have the property `I = R * R'`, but this isn't enforced by the constructor.
On the other hand, all the types below are guaranteed to be "proper" rotations for all input parameters (equivalently: parity conserving, in ``SO(3)``, ``det(r) = 1``, or a rotation without reflection).
